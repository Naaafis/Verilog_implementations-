Verilog implementation of T flip flops, D flip flop, JK slip slop. 

Includes synchronous as well as ascynchronous clocks and resets.

Practiced hierarchy by building JK from D flip flop, and D flip flop from T flip flop.

FINALBOSS includes circuit concisting of MUX and all three flip flops plus some gates.

Simulation sources included.
